Introduction to “Energy is the Other Form of Matter. High Compression Pressure is One of the Ways to Convert Matter to Energy”
It is well known that matter occupies space, while energy does not. We also know from Einstein’s famous equation, E = mc², that matter can be converted into energy. But what happens if a piece of matter is compressed beyond the minimum volume it can occupy?
It is logical to propose that under extreme compression, matter may be forced to convert into energy as a way to release that pressure. Let’s explore the validity of this assumption with a known phenomenon: when an electron meets a positron, they annihilate each other and produce two photons of 0.511 MeV each. What drives this transformation? The most logical explanation is that the extreme attractive force between them creates such high compression pressure that the matter converts into energy.
In 1981, I wrote a paper titled “Another View of the Sun,” where I assumed the Sun’s core is composed of 80% iron and 20% silicon. At that time, I had not yet identified the Sun’s true energy source. Years later, in 2009, through deep reflection—a habit of mine—I reached a new insight: the energy of the Sun may come from the extreme compression pressure at its core, which could be converting matter into energy.
This led me to write two related papers:
•	“Energy is the Other Form of Matter. High Compression Pressure is One of the Ways to Convert Matter to Energy” – which lays out this fundamental idea.
•	“Do We Know Our Sun and Its Origin?” – which applies this principle to explain the Sun’s energy source.
These papers are part of my broader effort to re-examine established scientific assumptions using logic, evidence, and the principles of my Scientific Life Theory.
